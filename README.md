## Introduction
This software renders html in alignment with its plain text source and Document object model(DOM) representation. They are displayed in three separate viewports(or windows, etc). selections (made by mouse) in any one viewport highlights corresponding components in the other two, and lines trace a path across all three viewports. 

This platform intends to articulate the relationship between code as it is composed (in plain text form), and executed (in this case, rendered as an html element).


This project began as an initial implementation of the software schematic proposed in the thesis document (linked above). It was first presented in an extremely rudimentary state, to illustrate how such a platform might function. It is, by definition, a proof of concept. 

## Instructions
Instructions & other details forthcoming.
